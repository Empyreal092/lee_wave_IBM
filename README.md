# Using penalty immersed boundary method to simulate lee wave past topography
This is the final project for [Immersed Boundary course](https://math.nyu.edu/~peskin/ib_lecture_notes/index.html) at NYU Courant in Spring of 2023. The pdf of the report is [here](https://github.com/Empyreal092/lee_wave_IBM/blob/main/lee_wave_IBM.pdf).

The code is a modification of the [2D Matlab implementation](https://math.nyu.edu/~peskin/ib_lecture_notes/ib_matlab_2D.tar) on the course website. Our implementation allows for rectangular domain with anisotropic discretization.
